/**
 * Cuckoo Hashing Exercise
 *
 * Cuckoo hashing is a scheme for resolving hash collisions of keys in 
 * a hashmap that maintains a worst-case constant lookup time, O(1). 
 * The name derives from the behavior of some species of cuckoo, where 
 * the cuckoo chick pushes the other eggs or young out of the nest when 
 * it hatches in a variation of the behavior referred to as brood 
 * parasitism; analogously, inserting a new key into a cuckoo hashing 
 * table may push an older key to a different location in the table.
 *
 * Constructor:
 *    CuckooHash( size )  - Where size is the initial bucket size 
 *                          of the hashmap
 *
 * Public Methods:
 *    int     size()	   - The number of elements, <key,value> pairs,
 *                           in the hashmap
 *    void    clear()	   - Empty the hashmap.
 *    List<V> values()     - Return a List of all values of type 'V' in 
 *                           the hashmap.
 *    Set<K>  keys() 	   - Return a Set of all keys of type 'K" in
 *                           the hashmap.
 *    void    put(K,V)	   - Insert the <key,value> pair of types K and V.
 *    V       get(K)	   - Return the value of type V for the key
 *                           provided of type K.
 *    boolean remove(K, V) - Remove  <key, value> pair, return true 
 *                           if found and removed, else false.
 *    String printTable()  - Return a String representing a
 *                           concatenation of all <key,value> pairs.

	/**
	 * Method put
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 * Adds a key-value pair to the table by means of cuckoo hashing.
	 *      * Each element can only be inserted into one of two bucket locations,
	 *      * defined by the two separate hash functions, h1(key) or h2(key).
	 * 	 * Each element's initial location will always be defined
	 * 	 * by h1(key). If later it is kicked out of that bucket location by
	 *      * another element insertion, it will move back and forth between those
	 *      *  two hash locations (aka, bucket locations).
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 * On its initial invocation, this method places the passed <key,value>
	 * 	 * element at its h1(key) bucket location. If an element is already located
	 * 	 * at that bucket location, it will be kicked out and moved to its secondary
	 * 	 * location in order to make room for this initially inserted element. The
	 * 	 * secondary location is defined by the kicked out key's alternative hash
	 * 	 * function (aka, either h1(key) or h2(key), whichever is the one that moves
	 * 	 * to the alternate location.
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 * This process will continue in a loop as it moves kicked out
	 *      * elements to their alternate location (defined by h1(key) and h2(key))
	 *      * until either:
	 * 	 *         (1) an empty bucket is found, or
	 * 	 *         (2) we reach 'n' iterations, where 'n' is the bucket capacity
	 * 	 *             of the hashmap (see HINT below on this method of cycle
	 * 	 *             detection, the bucket capacity is held in variable 'CAPACITY').
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 * If we reach 'n' shuffles of elements being kicked out and moved to their
	 *      * secondary locations (leading to what appears to be a cycle), we will grow
	 * 	 * the hashmap and rehash (via method rehash()). After the rehash, we will
	 * 	 * need to re-invoke this method recursively, as we will have one element that
	 * 	 * was kicked out after the 'n' iteration that still needs to be inserted. Note,
	 * 	 * that it is possible when the bucket lists is small, that we may need to rehash
	 * 	 * twice to break a cycle. Again, this is done automatically when calling this
	 * 	 * method recursively.
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 * MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE HINTS:
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 * HINT 1: To make sure you pass the provided tests in main, follow this rule:
	 * 	 *          - Given a <key, value> via method's invocation, the bucket it
	 * 	 *            determined by hashing the 'key'
	 * 	 *          - Normally, we would not allow dupe keys, for our purposes here we
	 * 	 *            WILL allow. What will be unique in this assignment's implementation
	 * 	 *            is the <key,value> in the table. So when inserting a key that is
	 * 	 *            already in the table, continue unless a dupe key has the same
	 * 	 *            value as being inserted.
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 *      The above is being done to make testing easy on causing cycles with minimal
	 * 	 *      insertions into the hash table.
	 * 	 *
	 * 	 * HINT 2: For simplicity of this assignment, after shuffling elements between
	 * 	 * buckets 'n' times (where 'n' is defined by the value of variable 'CAPACITY',
	 * 	 * you can assume you are in an infinite cycle. This may not be true, but if
	 * 	 * growing the hash map when not in a cycle, this will not cause data integrity
	 * 	 * issues. BUT BE CLEAR IN PRACTICE, as we discussed in class, a better way to
	 * 	 * do this is to build a graph (one edge at a time) for each element shuffled
	 * 	 * (and edge being defined as with end-points of the two bucket locations for the
	 * 	 * moved element). This once a cycle is detected in this graph, which is by starting
	 * 	 * to traverse an existing edge in the graph, we have a cycle. However, we have not
	 * 	 * discussed graphs yet, they are at the end of the semester :-)
	 *
