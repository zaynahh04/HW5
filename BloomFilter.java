/**
 * Bloom Filters
 *
 * A Bloom filter is an implementation of a set which allows a certain 
 * probability of 'false positives' when determining if a given object is 
 * a member of that set, in return for a reduction in the amount of memory 
 * required for the set. It effectively works as follows:
 *    1) We allocate 'm' bits to represent the set data.
 *    2) We provide a hash function, which, instead of a single hash code, 
         produces'k' hash codes and sets those bits.
 *    3) To add an element to the set, we derive bit indexes from all 'k' 
         hash codes and set those bits.
 *    4) To determine if an element is in the set, we again calculate the 
 *       corresponding hash codes and bit indexes, and say it is likely 
 *       present if and only if all corresponding bits are set.
 *
 * The margin of error (or false positive rate) thus comes from the fact 
 * that as we add more and more objects to the set, we increase the likelihood
 * of "accidentally" setting a combination of bits that corresponds to an 
 * element that isn't actually in the set. However, through tuning the bloom 
 * filter setup based on the expected data, we mathematically have control 
 * over the desired false positive probability rate that we want to received
 * based on probability theory.
 *
 * False Positive rate discussion:
 *
 * The Bloom filter performance changes as we change parameters discussed 
 * below with the class constructors. There are two key variables that impact 
 * the false positive rate:
 *     1) number of bits per item
 *     2) number of hash codes
 *
 * In other words, how many more bits are there in the filter than the 
 * maximum number of items we want to represent in the set, and hence the 
 * number of bits that we actually set for each element that we add to the 
 * set. The more bits we require to be marked as set to '1' in order to mark 
 * an element as 'present' - e.g., the more hash code per item - the lower the 
 * chance of false positives, because for a given element potentially in
 * the set, there's less chance of some random combination of bits from other 
 * elements also accidentally marking that element as present when it isn't.
 *
 * But, for a given bit filter size, there is a 'point of no return', at 
 * which having more hash codes simply means that we fill up the bit set too 
 * quickly as we add elements -- and hence get more false positives -- than 
 * with fewer hash codes.
 *
 * Based on this discussion, you can find many Bloom Filter calculators 
 * available online to determine how to adjust the variables inorder to 
 * achieve the desired probability of false positive rates that you can 
 * tolerate and/or desire for your application, e.g.,:

    /*
     * Hash provision code provided below:
     *
     * The following methods implement a strong 64-bit hash function, which
     * produces a good dispersal. In other words, given a random set of
     * elements to hash, there is a high chance that our hash function will
     * produce corresponding hash codes that are well dispersed over the
     * possible range of hash codes. Hence:
     *    1) whatever the size of the hash table, the number of collisions will
     *       be close to the number that we would "theoretically" expect;
     *    2) for a given hash code width (i.e. the number of bits in the hash
     *       code), we can predict how likely it is for the above-mentioned goal
     *       to be met; e.g. given a typical random selection of element, for
     *       each element to be given a unique hash code.
     *
     * Additional discussion on hash implementation:
     *
     * Notice that Java's hash table implementation — and hence implementations
     * of hashCode() — don't require the goals above to be met. Java maps and 
     * sets, rather than storing just the hash code, store the actual key object.
     * This means that implementations of hashCode() generally only need to
     * be "fairly good". It isn't the end of the world if two key objects have
     * the same hash function, because the keys themselves are also compared in
     * deciding if a match has been found.
     *
     * Below implements a 64-bit Linear Congruential Generator (LCG). It uses 
     * a table of 256 random values indexed by successive bytes in the data, 
     * and recommends a multiple suitable for an LCG with a modulus of 2^64,
     * which is effectively what we have when we multiple using 64-bit long.
     *
     * The value of HMULT is found to be a good practice with 64-bit LCG. It 
     * has roughly half of its bits set and is 'virtually' prime (it is 
     * composed of three prime factors). The value of HSTART is arbitrary, 
     * essentially any value would do.
     *
     * Fore more information:
     *      Read about 'Linear Congruential Generators' (LCG) in the Literature.

     * Constructors discussion:
     *
     *   1) The first constructor will take as the first parameter the
     *      base 2 logarithm of the number of bits, so passing an
     *      example of 16, gives you a bloom filter of size 2^16. The
     *      second parameter is the number of hash functions to use.
     *
     *   2) On the second constructor, consider that we can calculate
     *      bit indexes from hash codes simply by ANDing with the mask. In
     *      actual practice, we may not want to have to pass in the logarithm
     *      of the number of bits, so we also provide a constructor that
     *      in effect calculates the required value from a maximum number of
     *      items and a number of bits per item.
